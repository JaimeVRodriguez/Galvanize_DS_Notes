## Probability

### Probability Introduction
#### Probabilty
- A branch of mathematics concerned with quantifying how likely it is an event will occur

0 = Impossible
1 = Certain

Notation - Probabilty of heads is .5 or 50%
* P(H) = 0.5


#### Random Variable
- Quantifying the chanc eof an unseen event ocurring
- Outcome that depends on a random phenomenon

### Sets
#### Set
- A collection of **distinct** items (i.e. sets contain no duplicate elements)
- The items in this set are frequently referred to as members or elements of the set

C = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}

#### Unions (or)
A = {1, 2, 3}    B = {4, 5, 6}
A ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}

A = {3, 8, 9, 10}    B = {4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
A ∪ B = {3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}

#### Intersections (and)
A = {1, 2, 3}    B = {4, 5, 6}
A ∩ B = ∅

#### Couting Elements of a set
n(A) or ⎮A⎮


### Unions
P(E) = n(E) / n(S)

P(R) = 26/52
P(K) = 4/52
P(R∩K) = 2/52

26 + 4 - 2 = 28/52

prime = 2 3 5 7 11 13 17
even = 1 3 5 7 9 11 13 15 17
both = 3 5 7 11 13 17

#### Independent events
Probility Law for Two Events
P(A) * P(B)

2/6 * 3/6

1/7776 

#### Dependent events
P(AndB) = P(A) x P(B|A)
