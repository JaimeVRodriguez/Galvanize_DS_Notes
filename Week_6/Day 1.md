## Combinatorics

### Permutations vs Combinations

Permutation - counting the number of possible outcomes in a set when order matters

Combination - counting the number of possible outcomes in a set when order does not matter

```py
import math as f
( f(total_options) / f(total_options/openings) )/ f(openings)
```
